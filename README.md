# Otome Game Talking NPCs

This project gives voice to your game boyfriend.


## What It Does

You talk → He listens → He thinks → He talks back  
All in Mandarin, all in character.

Behind the scenes:

- **Whisper (ASR)** — turns your voice into text  
  *(Radford et al., 2022)*

- **Yi-1.5-6B-Chat (LLM)** — writes the perfect in-character reply  
  *(AI et al., 2025)*

- **CosyVoice2 (TTS)** — speaks it with the right emotion and voice style  
  *(Du, Chen, et al., 2024)*
